# Quality Control

This module will calculate sample and amplicon coverage from your demultiplexed reads. 

## File Outputs

### sample_coverage.txt / amplicon_coverage.txt 
These provide the number of reads in your sequencing files at the sample and amplicon level, respectively. Additionally, the sample coverage file will provide read counts post quality filtering and removal of primer dimers.
