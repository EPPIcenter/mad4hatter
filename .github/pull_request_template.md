## PR checklist

- [ ] I have added a description of changes (with reason).
- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have added/updated tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] If you've added a new tool - have you included any updates to the environment (i.e. Dockerfile)
- [ ] Ensure the test suite passes (`nf-test test --profile docker,test`).
- [ ] Usage Documentation in `gh-pages` branch is updates
- [ ] `README.md` is updated if appropriate.
- [ ] Terra version has also been updated accordingly, if necessary
